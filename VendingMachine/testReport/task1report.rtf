\f0\fs24 \cf0 Task1-Code Coverage-Vending Machine\
The EclEmma coverage tool was quite useful in seeing which lines of code were not executed during test suite execution. When creating the test suite in Project 4, I attempted to cover all variations and instances of test cases, however, after running EclEmma to check for coverage, I missed some very simple lines of code. Regarding the Vending Machine project, I neglected to test any instance of using slots 'C' and 'D' completely! I just assumed testing a slot for expected values would suffice, not all possible slots. \
\
The weakness of this testing with purely code coverage is that one can execute every line of code in testing and still not find bugs. We've already been told there are bugs in the Vending Machine code, and while I have 100% coverage, I haven't found the bugs!}
