\f0\fs24 \cf0 Task 3- Fibonacci\
\
This task was very simple. When running the jUnit tester, we saw that the expected assertion should be '0' but we received a '1'. In looking at the Fibonacci.java we could see in the switch statement that if the case was '0' to return a '1'. Hence our problem. Changing the return value from a '1' to a '0' fixed the bug, and then the jUnit test ran smoothly with no errors.}
